                    This is one of my most recent projects that I have worked on
                    and still working on this year. Maskoc Works is the name of
                    the website, and they offer services of building websites
                    for clients around Canada.<br />As you can see, this website
                    is still in early development. This website is currently for
                    a First Nation Organization or soon to be one. Due to
                    school, this project has halted for now, but will continue
                    after the christmas break.<br /><bt /> I do intend on
                    finishing this website by January 20<sup>th</sup>, 2025

                    This project is one of the most important projects to date
                    behind the Maskoc Works Project. The reason why is because
                    how much effort was put into that website. The amount of
                    effort and detail that was put into the project to make it
                    look good and modern it impressive. I am very proud of this
                    project, and I use to test new code.

                    This is a somewhat new project which I am proud about. The
                    reason I am very proud of this project is because of the
                    amount of small details that you might have seen. There are
                    many small details that unless you were looking for, won't
                    get to appreciate it. This project will play a role later
                    and how much details I will look for, and add to make
                    websites look modern.

                    Not an very impressive Website that you might have ever
                    seen, however. This is one of the most important websites as
                    it was one of my first attempts in making a website that is
                    accessible. I had never used accessibility features a lot up
                    until this project. This was also my start for caring for
                    smaller details, which will matter for later projects.
